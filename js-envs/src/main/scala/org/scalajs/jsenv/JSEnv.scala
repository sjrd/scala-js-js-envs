  /** Like [[start]], but initializes a communication channel.
   *
   *  Inside the VM this is to provide a global JavaScript object named
   *  `scalajsCom` that can be used to interact with the message channel. Its
   *  operations are:
   *  {{{
   *  // initialize com (with callback). May only be called once.
   *  scalajsCom.init(function(msg) { console.log("Received: " + msg); });
   *
   *  // send a message to host system
   *  scalajsCom.send("my message");
   *  }}}
   *
   *  We describe the expected message delivery guarantees by denoting the
   *  transmitter as `t` and  the receiver as `r`. Both the JVM and the JS end
   *  act once as a transmitter and once as a receiver. These two
   *  transmitter/receiver pairs (JS/JVM and JVM/JS) are independent.
   *
   *  For a pair `(t,r)`:
   *  <ul>
   *  <li>If `t` calls [[JSComRun#send]] exactly in the sequence
   *  {{{
   *  send(m_1), ..., send(m_n)
   *  }}}
   *
   *  and `r` observes `onMessage(m_k)` (k <= n) but not `onMessage(m_{k+1})`,
   *  `r` must observe
   *  {{{
   *  onMessage(m_1), ..., onMessage(m_k)
   *  }}}
   *  exactly in this order.
   *  <li>If `t` and `r` keep running indefinitely and `t` sends n messages,
   *  `r` receives n messages.
   *  </ul>
   *
   *  @param onMessage Callback invoked each time a message is received from the
   *      JS VM. The implementation may not call this anymore once
   *      [[JSRun#future]] of the returned [[JSComRun]] is completed. Further,
   *      [[JSRun#future]] may only complete with no callback in-flight.
